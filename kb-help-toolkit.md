## Lubing and related mods
### How to lube stabilizers without desoldering
https://switchandclick.com/2020/06/24/how-to-lube-stabilizers-without-desoldering-in-5-easy-steps/

### Clipping, lubing, and band-aid modding stabilizers (with desoldering)

### Through-hole bandaid mod
some stabilizers make a tick sound even when lubed, this fixes that issue

### Best switch lube for every scenario
https://www.keebtalk.com/t/which-lube-for-switch-lube-an-updated-guide-on-the-what-how-and-where-of-switch-lubricants/5052

### Stabilizer lube to use
Broke: Permatex for wire, teflon grease for stem

Slightly less broke: Permatex for wire, 205g0 for the stem

Rich: 205g0 for awire and stem

### Difference between G0 and G2
As per Switchmod.net:
> Krytox GPL 205 GRADE 0 is not normal Krytox GPL 205 (GRADE 2). It has a higher PFPE content, and a binder to keep the PFPE and PTFE bases from separating. As such, it is slightly more fluid than GRADE 2 GPL 205. This makes it much easier to apply and makes the switch smoother.

### Difference between normal lube and Krytox/Tribosys
As per the MechKeys discord:
> Just want to let yall know the difference between Super Lube Synthetic Grease with PTFE (Henceforth just "Superlube") and Krytox/other fully flourinated greases.
>
> First: Super lube is a suspension of Lithium grease, and bits of PTFE powder, in effect, its basically just lithium grease, the bits of PTFE powder the put into it makes no real difference. Its primarily (95%+) lithium grease. Krytox, and other fully flourinated greases (Tribosys, Christo-lube, ulubrol krytox equiv) are composed of PFPE + PTFE + a tiny bit of binder (<1%). PFPE is basically liquid PTFE, and therefore is on paper, smoother due to the fact that PFPE and PTFE have signficantly lower coefficents of friction than simple lithium grease. While I can't quantify the benefits of this, it theoretically should be better.
>
> Second, notice on the compatibility chart of Superlube that its compatibility with polycarbonate (what many switches are made from) is simply "good" as opposed to excellent. This makes me doubt the effects of super lube on polycarbonate switches such as Alpacas whose housings are made from a combination of Polycarbonate and Nylon, and other polycarbonate based switches like Everglides.
>
> while these differences are small, insofar as it costs like 2 cents/switch for using Krytox (3ml/9$ from Krelbit, lasts ~400 switches for me), I'd rather have the benefits, while they might be small, of Krytox or other fully flourinated greases over superlube.

The top part applies only to SL oil, but the rest applies for all lube (SL silicone, permatex, etc)

## Keycaps
### (~Good~) keycap manufacturers, locations, and profiles:
- GMK - Cherry Profile - Germany
- EnjoyPBT - Cherry Profile - China
- Signature Plastics - SA/DSA - USA
- Maxkey - SA - China 
- Keyreative - OEM/KAT - China
- Tai-Hao - OEM/Cubic - Taiwan
- HK Gaming - OEM - Hong Kong


### Different keycap profiles

### Budget keycaps?
HK Gaming, or Tai-Hao Cubic.

### Budget **BACKLIT** keycaps?
Just go find something on amazon, not much luck with backlit caps on anything premium

### Keycap Incompatibility
A couple things to note when recommending keycaps.

This should be a given, but keycaps with different mounts are not compatible with other mounts. Please stop recommending MX caps to people asking about choc v1 boards

Also, Cherry profile does not act nicely when paired with north-facing LEDs. If your PCB uses north-facing LEDs, no cherry profile for you

Otherwise, besides possible issues with RGB shinethrough, you should be fine.
